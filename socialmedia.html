                    <h2> Barbie Memes </h2>

                    <p> Keeping up with the trends of a constantly changing social media scene. In an effort to stay on brand, but also have some fun, I decided to feature our student assistants and their career goals. Using the meme generator during the promotion of the Barbie movie. This was a way to be relatable to our audience, while also staying on brand with our account. </p>

                    <p> One of my favorite things that I did for CSC was start posting dumps. Previously to my start, their feed was very static and just promotion, and I was able to mix in the promotion aspects, as well as related content to the events. </p>

                        <p> One of my favorite pieces was a seamless carousel that celebrated all the things that we did as a program during the 2022-2023 school year. Playing into the nostalgia but also wishing everyone a great summer, this post encapsulates the feeling and vibe that the school year had. </p>
