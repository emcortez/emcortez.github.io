                    <h2> Barbie Memes </h2>

                    <p> Keeping up with the trends of a constantly changing social media scene. In an effort to stay on brand, but also have some fun, I decided to feature our student assistants and their career goals. Using the meme generator during the promotion of the Barbie movie. This was a way to be relatable to our audience, while also staying on brand with our account. </p>

                    <h6><i>March 2023, Adobe Illustrator</i></h6>
                    <p> The San Francisco Giants’ winning three World Series in 5 years is a pivotal moment in San Francisco's history. The three icons focus on moments that make the Giants unique part of the culture in SF: walking into Oracle Park on your dad’s shoulders, the 3 World Series trophies in display with confetti falling during the parade, and the splash hits that hit McCovey Cove on those summer days.</p>

                    <p> The idea of being alone is scary for many, however, portrayed is the idea that it is not so bad as people make it out to be. Inspired by a saying that my mom says to me, and during a dark time in my life, this poster series is meant to portray resilience and lonesome can actually be a good thing. This series was a struggle for me, as I had too many ideas and such little time.</p>

                    <h6><i>February 2023, Adobe Illustrator </i></h6>
                    <p> A tattoo is supposed to have meaning to the person. This tattoo is Saturn, one of my favorite planets, which also represents hard work and karma. Adorning the planet are the flowers, Lily of the Garden, Daffodil and Chrysanthemums, the birth flowers of my family and I. When designing this tattoo, I knew it would have to be meaningful, and a tattoo I would be willing to put on my own body.</p>
