                    <h2> Architectural Design</h2>
                    <h5><i>September 2022, Adobe Illustrator</i></h5>
                    <p> Architecture is all around us, especially on a beautiful college campus like USF. This project captured form from buildings on campus with a 5-color palette. The University Center (the bottom right one), although very detailed, became the most satisfying one to complete. </p>

                    <h2> 3 Icons </h2>
                    <h5><i>March 2023, Adobe Illustrator</i></h5>
                    <p> The San Francisco Giants’ winning three World Series in 5 years is a pivotal moment in San Francisco's history. The three icons focus on moments that make the Giants unique part of the culture in SF: walking into Oracle Park on your dad’s shoulders, the 3 World Series trophies in display with confetti falling during the parade, and the splash hits that hit McCovey Cove on those summer days.</p>

                    <h2> Poster Series </h2>
                    <h5><i>October 2022, Adobe Photoshop </i></h5>
                    <p> The idea of being alone is scary for many, however, portrayed is the idea that it is not so bad as people make it out to be. Inspired by a saying that my mom says to me, and during a dark time in my life, this poster series is meant to portray resilience and lonesome can actually be a good thing. This series was a struggle for me, as I had too many ideas and such little time.</p>

                    <h2> Tattoo You </h2>
                    <h5><i>February 2023, Adobe Illustrator </i></h5>
                    <p> A tattoo is supposed to have meaning to the person. This tattoo is Saturn, one of my favorite planets, which also represents hard work and karma. Adorning the planet are the flowers, Lily of the Garden, Daffodil and Chrysanthemums, the birth flowers of my family and I. When designing this tattoo, I knew it would have to be meaningful, and a tattoo I would be willing to put on my own body.</p>
